The ping command by itself sends continuous ICMP packets to a specified host to test network connectivity and measures the round-trip time for each packet. When used with the -c 4 flag, ping sends exactly 4 packets instead of running indefinitely. I observed that all 4 packets to www.google.com were successfully received with 0% packet loss and varying round-trip times (170–658 ms).
