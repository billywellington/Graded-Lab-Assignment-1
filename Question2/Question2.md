# Question 2 [5 points] — File and Directory Management

You are working as a junior system administrator responsible for organizing project-related files in your home directory. Your supervisor wants you to demonstrate your understanding of Linux file and directory management commands.



## 1. Project Workspace Setup

Create a directory named `documents` inside your home directory. This directory will store your project-related files.



## 2. File Creation

Navigate into the `documents` directory and create a file named `plan.txt`.



## 3. Content Addition

Write some sample text of your choice into the `plan.txt` file. The content can be a short project note or reminder.



## 4. File Metadata Verification

Display the permissions and ownership details of the `plan.txt` file. Ensure your username appears in the output.



## 5. File Duplication

Create a copy of `plan.txt` and name it `plan_copy.txt`.



## 6. Directory Renaming

Rename the `documents` directory to `project_documents` to reflect the project scope more clearly.



## 7. Archival Structure

Inside the `project_documents` directory, create a subdirectory named `archive`.



## 8. File Organization

Move `plan_copy.txt` into the `archive` subdirectory.



## 9. Recursive Listing

List all files and subdirectories inside `project_documents` recursively so that the complete directory structure is visible.



## 10. Path Verification

Display the absolute path of the `plan_copy.txt` file after it has been moved to the `archive` directory.
